Useful stata commands

Plot mean vs data to check for Heterogeneity
 bysort agecat: egen mortrate_mean = mean(mortrate)
 twoway scatter mortrate agecat, msymbol(circle_hollow) || connected mortrate_mean agecat, msymbol(diamond)

Gen a log series
gen logmortrate_mean = log(mortrate_mean)
 
Simple pooled OLS regression and plot it
regress logmortrate smokerate
twoway scatter logmortrate smokerate, mlabel(agecat) || lfit logmortrate smokerate , clstyle(p2)

Do FE regression using least squares dummy variable model (LSDV)
 xi: regress logmortrate logsmokerate logwealth trend i.agecat
 

Do RE model
xtreg logmortrate logsmokerate logwealth trend, re

Do Hausman
xtreg logmortrate logsmokerate logwealth trend, fe
estimates store fixed
xtreg logmortrate logsmokerate logwealth trend, re
estimates store random
hausman fixed random

Testing for time fixed effects
xtreg logmortrate logsmokerate logwealth trend i.wave, fe
testparm i.wave

If prob > 0.05, reject H0 that all years are jointly zero so need to use time fixed effects

Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian Mult test for random effects
xtreg y x1, re
xttest0
If < 0.05 random effects is appropriate

Testing for cS dependence/contemporaneous correlation
Breusch Pagan LM test for independence
xtreg y x1, fe
xttest2

if pr > 0.05 no cS depence

using Pasaran CD tet
xtreg y x1, fe
xtcsd, peasaran abs

if pr > 0.05 no cS depence

Test for hetero
ssc install xtest3
xttest3
Pro < 0.05 = hetereo

Tet for serial correlation
ssc install xtserial
xtserial y x1

Pro < 0.05 = no serial correlation

Test for unit root/stationarity
xtunitroot

Trying to just do a regression
regress y x, robust
not sure if robust is needed or not

Store as var the fitted vals
predict yhat

anal of residuals
We are assuming the variance of the residuals is homoskedastic or constant
plot them
rvfplot, yline(0)

Residuals seem to be slightly narrower at higher values
