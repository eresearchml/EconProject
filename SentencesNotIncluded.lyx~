I'd like to see what kind of socio economic effects are heavily linked with
 mortality.
 I think things such as income, savings, smoker status, social class, tv
 watching, alcohol, physical activity are related to mortality.
 My hypothesis is that per6ceived unhealthy behaviours such as tv watching,
 smoking, alcohol will be positively correlated with mortality and percieved
 positive behaviours such as physical activity, income, savings and social
 class will the negatively correlated with mortality.
 Such things as age and sex are already widely regarded as being negatively
 correlated with mortality and regards sex, women living longer than men
 so I'm trying to dig deeper than that for this project.

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a vast amount of research into the link between smoking and
 premature death.
 This survey also wants to see what life was like for individuals before
 their deaths.
 So a lot of the health data is concerned with how good the quality of life
 is for people prior to their death.
 This includes living with certain conditions, how ability to walk, wash
 and clothe oneself impacts of mortality.
 And how mental health affects.

An application I will walk you through many applications of fixed effect
 models.
 Here is one to ponder.
 There have recently been high profile studies of the relationship between
 staffing in hospitals and patient outcomes.
 These studies use traditional OLS regression where the unit of observation
 is the patient, the dependent variable is some outcome measure like mortality
 (a dummy variable that equals 1 if the patient died in the hospital) and
 the key predictor is staffing (e.g., nurses per patient).
 These studies do not use fixed effects, and invariably show that hospitals
 with more staff have better patient outcomes.
 These results have had enormous policy implications.
 Unfortunately, these studies may suffer from omitted variable bias.
 For example, the key unobservable variable might be the severity of patientsâ€™
 illnesses, which is notoriously difficult to control for with available
 data.
 Severity is likely to be correlated with both mortality and staffing, so
 that the coefficient on staffing will be biased.
 (What is the direction of the bias?) If you ran a hospital fixed-effects
 model, you would include hospital dummies in the regression that would
 control for observable and unobservable differences in severity (and all
 other factors) across hospitals.
 This would greatly reduce potential omitted variable bias.
 None of the current research in this field has done so, perhaps because
 there is not enough intrahospital variation in staffing to allow for fixed-effe
cts estimation.
 Even a fixed effects model would not completely eliminate potential omitted
 variable bias.
 You must also hope that any changes over time in unobservable patient severity
 within each hospital are uncorrelated with changes over time in staffing.
 This might not be such a good assumption.
 As hospitals experience increases in severity, they may increase staffing.
 If so, then unobservable severity within a hospital is correlated with
 staffing and the omitted variable bias is still present.

The theory behind fixed effects regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we believe the regression has the same shape within each of these groups
 over time, we can estimate the average of the regressions.
 The way fixed effects regressions handle this is to calculate the changes
 wrt to the mean of those changes within the group.
 So we want to know whether variations in mortality are related to variations
 in our effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are trying to estimate coefficients of regression for a number of factors
 (listed above) but across a wide range of different groups.
 To eliminate some of these differences between the groups

\begin_layout Standard
This is known as fixed effects regression becuase it holds constant (fixes)
 the average effects of each group.

FE removes time constant variables so any group specific factors that are
 constant over time are not measured.
 So from our intuition we think that FE does not do enough to cover what
 we are trying to estimate.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst the panel data asks a very broad range of questions it can never
 fully capture the variability between individuals either through variable
 being outside of the scope or inadequacies in the estimation procedure.
 We also suffer from only having 5 time data points to compare our sample
 over.

\begin_layout Standard
Smoking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our analysis we also want to see what effects our independent variables
 have on the log or mortality rate.
 So throughout our dependent variable will be log mortality.
 For example if something such as smoking would increase your probability
 of death in the next year then it follows that we should be regressing
 this against the log mortality rate.
