\begin_layout Abstract
This paper uses the English Longditudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) 2002-13,
 to explore factors affecting mortality in individuals over 50 years of
 age.
 It finds that a random effects model is appropriate for exporing factors
 affecting mortality.
 Further it finds that age and smoker status are positively linked with
 log mortality in the 50-86 year age range.
 Unlike studies for other countries, links between wealth and mortality
 were not found, which the author suggests may be down to the national health
 service.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demographics of the UK are changing.
 We have a population that is increasing and ageing.
 The life expectancy for men and women is predicted to be 93.5 for men and
 96.5 for women by 2030.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

Big advances have been made in nutrition, health and hygiene over the last
 century which has increased life expectancy at birth by around 30 years.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

Exploring the causes of mortality not only allows policy to be formed that
 more efficiently manages resources for this ageing population but also
 allows education of individuals to choose lifestyle choices that will reduce
 their risk of early death.
 In a developed country such as the UK, mortality rates at younger ages
 is very low so the most effective improvements in mortality come from focusing
 on the older population

\begin_layout Standard
The English Longditudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a study which started
 in 2002 focusing on following a group of approximately 10,000 individuals
 over 50 years of age.
 These individuals were selected to be a representative sample of the population
 aged over 50.
 The study is designed to investigate demographics, economic data and health
 data over multiple years, thereby following the individuals from pre-retirement
 until death.
 The breadth of the study offers the ability to investigate many links between
 economic and lifestyle factors, and health.
 Health is extensively questioned in the survey to gather a measure for
 quality of life as the respondents aged.
 Government policy should be targetted at not only extending life expectancy
 but also the quality of life.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper uses the ELSA data and follows the original 10,444 individuals

 or fully to the questionaire in 2002 until the most recent update of the
 death records in 2013.
 Individuals allowed access to their death records enabling researchers
 to check their status even when they became non-respondent to the survey.
 The questionnaires were either conducted in an interview or administered
 in a paper form.
 The questionnaire's content varied over the years with supplemental questions
 and nurse visits every 4 years.
 A core set of questions was maintained and we draw our data from those.

\begin_layout Subsection
What factors affect mortality?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many lifestyle choices and economic factors are percieved to have an affect
 on life expectancy.
 Factors such as wealth, physical activity and occupational class have been
 shown to have a positive effect on life expectancy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mortalityandlifeexpectancy"

\end_inset

.
 Likewise, factors such as smoking and drinking alcohol have been showing
 to have a negative effect on life expectancy.
 A human's life is finite so age very clearly has a negative impact on life
 expectancy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we do find strong links betwen lifestyle factors and mortality rate,
 this will enable the government to use their resources in a more targeted
 manner.
 This paper highlights two factors, one positive and one negative (wealth
 and smoking), and investigates their usefulness in predicting mortality.
 Smoking is a lifestyle choice the government can influence by raising taxes.
 Wealth in later life can also be influenced over a longer timescale by
 incentivising people to save for their pensions with tax benefits.
 If we know the primary causes of mortality, policy makers can more effectively
 allocate resources, target policy (e.g.
 tax cuts for pensions) and disseminate information (e.g.
 smoking is harmful) to allow people to make informed choices of their lifestyle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary this paper seeks to answer the question: Are wealth and smoker
 status important factors in determining mortality as we age?

 They examined ELSA data up to wave 3 exploring demographic, socio-economic
 and lifestyle factors associated with increased risk of mortality.
 They found many factors that significantly affect mortality including,
 sex, wealth, education, occupational class, smoking, drinking and physical
 exercise.
 In part this paper attempts to examine if these factors are still relevant
 with the updated ELSA data.
 Combining this with an attempt to form a model incorporating some of these
 factors to weight they affects on the mortality rate.

\begin_layout Subsection
Mortality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When trying to determine predictors of mortality we face some difficulties
 if we analyze on an individual basis since our dependent variable is binary
 and individuals become non-respondent to the survey in the event of their
 death.
 This results in an unbalanced data set.
 For our analysis we formed groups based on age and occupational class which
 should provide good variability of the independent and dependent variables.
 The groups vary in size from 50-500 and the mortality rate for a wave will
 be defined as the percentage of deaths in that group occuring from the
 end of the previous wave up until the last month of wave data collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actuarial life tables have long been used as an impartial estimation of
 life expectancy for pensions and settlements.
 They are tables that provide the probability of dying within a calendar
 year and are often derived from empirical evidence.
 Broadly an individual's chance of dying within the next year is lowest
 when they are 10 years old and increases year on year.
 Many studies have been conducted to find a functional form for mortality

) it illustrates there are age ranges that appear to have a log linear relations
hip with mortality.
 For our dataset we are examining individuals from ages of 50-86 over a
 10 year period.
 The hypothesis is that it follows a log-linear path.

Smoking and Wealth

 the time of the wave.
 As this is a percentage we include this term as the logarithm of the smoking
 rate

\begin_layout Standard
This paper further hypotheses that the utility of wealth is not a linear
 function of mortality in this case 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "utilitywealth"

\end_inset

.
 The ways in which one can use wealth to affect their health has diminishing
 returns especially in a country with a national health service.
 Medical care is provided to even those with the lowest wealth and paying
 for healthcare does not necessarily guarantee a better outcome.
 In the context of a person's health the utility of wealth is monotonically
 non-decreasing.
 Moreover, there may be a threshold beyond which additional wealth cannot
 provide any additional gains.
 Once an individual can afford the best medical care available, additional
 wealth is not relevant.
 In this model the log wealth has been included as term 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads us to expect the coefficients or age and smoking

 to be negative.

Wave Dummies

\begin_layout Standard
We will include wave (time) dummies to account for each wave's idiosyncracies
 and allow each wave to have a different intercept.
 As they are conducted over different time periods it may be assumed that
 factors such as wealth for our whole set would not remain consistent from
 year to year.
 Naturally as the respondents get older each group's mortality rate should
 increase which wave dummies can take into account.

Panel Data Techniques
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We grouped the individuals into 48 subgroups based on age and occupational
 class.
 It seems likely that some of these groups have specific unobservable variables
 that do not vary over time and contribute to mortality.
 For example, an unobservable might be nutrition during childhood.
 During childhood nutrition is very important and differences could have
 impacted long term health of groups as nutrition was not as well understood
 50 years ago.
 This is likely to vary across our subgroups and be correlated with both
 age and mortality.
 This will make pooled OLS inconsistent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the data in the ELSA study follows the same people over multiple years
 it is most appropriate to investigate the use of panel data techniques
 to derive our coefficients.
 We are not including any time invariant variables in our model so both
 a random effects and fixed effects model were considered.
 A random effects model was selected as the subgroups variation is not being
 directly manipulated or tested.
 So by using random effects model we are looking at both the within group
 data and other groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will need to confirm our error terms are not correlated with our independent
 variables of age, wealth and smoke rate as the random effects estimator
 assumes 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(X_{it},u_{i})=0$
\end_inset

.
 If it violates this assumption we may need to reformulate as a fixed effects
 model.
 The Hausman test can determine if random effects is appropriate.

Questions to answer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our analysis would like to confirm that random effects is an appropriate
 model for predicting mortality from the ELSA data set.
 This would set up the ability for further work on factors which are both
 variant and invariant over time.
 The ELSA is a very rich data set with many such factors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also would like to find significant coefficients for age, smoking and
 wealth as contributory factors to mortality.
 There is evidence to suggest they are amongst the largest determinants.

 ELSA is a collaboration between Univeristy College London (UCL), the institute
 for Fiscal Sutdies (IFS) and NatCen Social Research.
 It is a large scale longditudinal panel study of men and women aged 50
 and over and their partners.
 The orginal (Wave 0) participants were drawn from the Health Survey for
 England (HSE) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Approximately 10,000 people are studied in each wave with the sample being
 refreshed in wave 3,4,6 and 7 due to people dropping out and death.
 Respondents were intervieved at approximately 2 yearly interviews, Wave
 1- March 2002 to March 2003, Wave 2 -June 2004 - July 2005, Wave 3- May
 2006-August 2007, Wave 4 - May 2008-July 2009, Wave 5 - June 2010-July

We are concerned with mortality data which has only been updated until Wave
 5 as of April 2017.
 We have selected 10,444 individuals who responded in the first wave and
 either responded in every wave up until their death or consented to allow
 access to their death records.
 In the case of missing responses to our questions in the survey we took
 the previous wave's response assuming the value of that variable had not
 changed.
 We selected the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $smokerstat$
\end_inset

 with a value of 4 (current smoker) to calculate the smoker rate within
 a group.
 We selected the average of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $netfw$
\end_inset

 within our group which is the net financial wealth of an individual to
 represent our wealth variable.
 We took the main 6 occupational classes from the 
\begin_inset Formula $asoccls$
\end_inset

 variable which is derived from the HSE social class classification.
 These range from professional to unskilled manual labour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper will focus on individuals who responded in the first wave and
 every wave up until their death.
 Our panel data models rely on balanced data set with no gaps.
 When respondents die they can obviously no longer provide responses to
 the questions in the data set.
 As the sample size is relatively large they are simply eliminatd from the
 group.
 As a result of this care, should be used when interpreting the decline
 in smoking rate with age.
 The decline is partially a result of people giving up smoking and partially
 a result of smokers dying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Wave 1 was the first full questionaire we can only deal with mortality
 after Wave 1.
 So our time periods are mortality prior to Wave 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 This gives us 4 time series points corresponding to 2005, 2007, 2009 and
 2011.

 The log mortality of the groupings vs their age is plotted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This suggests the ELSA data follows a similar trend to the actuarial table
 data.
 One thing to note is that the variance below 65 seems to be higher than
 post 65 which suggests heteroscedasticity.

Comparison of smokers and non-smokers showed that in both men and women

 data (

 ).
 Participants were split by sex and then into 8-quantiles on age in 2002.
 Smokers were defined as regular smokers as of Wave 1.
 Interesting to note in both men and women, the difference between a smoker
 and a non smoker's mortality rate increases with age.
 On the presumption that smokers rarely start smoking at an advanced age,
 this seems to highlight the cumulative detrimental effect of smoking.

\begin_layout Subsection
Wealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separating wealth into 5-quantiles and examing the mortality across age
 groups seems to have some effect depending on wealth but it is not marked
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Wealth-Mortality"

\end_inset

).
 We use the same age and sex categories as before.
 In ages below retirement (65) there seems to be little connection betwen
 wealth and mortality.
 These people are still of working age so they are more capable of changing
 their wealth into later life.
 At the lower end of wealth where people are in depth when they retire this
 does seem to detrimentally affect their life expectancy to some degree.
 This may be because they have to fall back only on the state pension which
 may be at a level that does have an effect.

that was based on data up to wave 3 that found there were marked differences
 in occupational class and wealth.
 Some age categories and occupations had no respondents die over the lifetime
 of the study.
 In these cases the group sizes were low which increases the noise of the
 mortality rate.
 In the ELSA 65% of respondents fall into either category II or IIM.

Statistical Model

\begin_layout Standard
Formulating our model as a random effects model is appropriate as there
 is a strong suspicion that differences across our subgroups have some influence
 on our dependent variable.
 If we formulated this as a fixed effects model it would be inefficient.
 If we formulated this as a pooled OLS regression we would be loosing the
 within group effects.
 The Hausmann test will indicate if our choice between random or fixed effects
 model is appropriate.
 The Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier Test will indicate if there is not
 enough variation amongst our groups to warrant a random effects model rather
 than simply pooled OLS.

Results

\begin_layout Subsection
Random Effects, Age and Smoking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results suggest that the random effects model is appropriate to model
 mortality in this case.
 With the Hausman test (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Hausman-Test"

\end_inset

) we failed to reject the null hypothesis which suggests a random effects
 model is appropriate.
 Similarly the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier Test (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Breusch-Pagan-Lagrange-Multiplie"

\end_inset

) we performed rejecting the null hypothesis and suggesting that there is
 significance across groups, leading to the conclusiong that a pooled OLS
 model would not be appropriate in this case.
 These two tests combined give strong evidence that a random effects model
 is appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting coefficients suggest the increasing age of a group is strongly
 linked with log mortality in the 50-86 year age range.
 The smoking rate appears to also be somewhat positively significant in
 predicting the mortality rate.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 outlines the full set of results for the analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using data from actuarial tables and running a regression of age vs log
 mortality gave us a coefficient and intercept inline with what we saw using
 the random effects model.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Random-Effects"

\end_inset

) It is encouraging that our figures are broadly inline with this independent
 dataset.
 Our coefficients illustrated a slightly shallower mortality curve which
 could be related to the continued trend of improvement in mortality

 compared to actuarial tables are updated infrequently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smoking rate proved somewhat significant, being rejected at the 95%
 confidence level and accepted at the 90% confidence level.
 The coefficient of smoking was around 3 times higher than age which translates
 into a very significant factor in the mortality rate.
 However we didn't find the required level of confidence in this figure.
 Whilst many studies have linked smoking to premature death 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-35"

\end_inset

 very strongly this was not universally confirmed in our results.
 What is surprising is in our data inspection (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Smoker-Mortality"

\end_inset

) we saw a marked difference betwen the smokers and non-smokers.
 This may indicate that a binary variable is more appropriate in future
 models.
 The reported rate of smoking declines with age which most likely is due
 to individuals quitting smoking as medical advice is abundant that it is
 in one's best interests to do.
 As we have mentioned previously the smoking rate is also affected by smokers
 dropping out of the group (dying).
 One reason the data may not show such a strong correlation is that whilst
 individuals do not currently smoke, the extent of their smoking in the
 past is not quantified in the study.
 The effects of which may only manifest themselves in later life.
 Many government policies have been put in place to stop people smoking
 by increasing tax on cigarettes, funding anti-smoking campaigns and putting
 health warnings on packets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our results wealth was not a significant factor in predicting mortality.
 Whilst wealth has been linked to mortality in the US 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "USwealthmort"

\end_inset

, wealth may not be such a strong influencer in a country with a national
 health service.
 As there is a good level of care in the UK for all individuals, wealth
 does not play such a primary role in affordability of healthcare.
 Breaking down our aggregate wealth measure into its parts such as housing
 may yield some significant.
 On an aggregate measure we did not see any significance in this study

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that a random effects model is appropriate for studying mortality
 rate in the context of the ELSA longditudinal study.
 Our analysis also confirmed that a group's age in the range from 50-85
 is strongly linked to mortality rate.
 We also found evidence in the data for the link between smoking and mortality
 which appears to be very large.
 An interesting by-product of this analysis was finding that the smoking
 rate does decline markedly for individuals over the age of 50.
 This could be attributed to the government's efforts funding campaigns
 to encourage people to give up smoking and warning them of the dangers
 that smoking can damage your health.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wealth, however, wa not found to be a significant factor in the analysis
 which we hypothesised was due to the NHS largely nullifying the wealth
 effect that can be seen in countries such as the United States.
 Government funding of the NHS has been heavily scrutinised over the years
 with funding in some areas being cut considerably.
 We may see a resurgence of the wealth effect if these cuts have a negative
 impact on the care the NHS is providing.
 Which in turn will lead to private healthcare starting to contribute to
 one's life expectancy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model goes some way in explaining mortality but there are many more
 factors in the ELSA that could be incorporated.
 There are a number of lifestyle factors that may add significant insight
 to the model such as measures of physical activity.
 How to include these factors into the model require some research as older
 physical activity can have many disparate forms.
 One problem would be how to compare 2 hours of walking with 30 minutes
 of gardening.
 Is one twice or three times as good as the other? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the complexity of life it follows that mortality is a very complex
 prediction problem.
 Any equation that we specify can only hope to model a portion of the mortality
 rate.
 Success of a model can be hard to define.
 Model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:-3"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 = 0.61 so there still exists a large portion of unexplained variance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Success in the model's specification in the basis of this survery would
 be to include only those factors within the survery that affect mortality.
 We found that wealth was not directly an important factor in mortality
 so should not be included in the form we initially modelled.
 This survery is a huge source of data.
 This leads us to believe there are variables which we could add to the
 the model specification from within the ELSA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
External to the survery there are a large number of factors which affect
 mortality, some of which could potentially be measured.
 For example genetics can play a large part in contraction of certain diseases
 which are determining factors in life expectancy.
 Genetics already helps profile women's likelihood of getting breast cancer.
 There are survey's out there that could be incorporated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variable that would be difficult to include, for example the number of
 reckless drivers in their neigbourhood that will affect their chance of
 getting hit by a car as they cross the road.
 Whilst the coefficients of these variables would likely be very small,
 there are a very large number of them which can add significantly to one's
 chances of mortality.
 We can see this simply by the figures of pedestrian's killed in 2012 was
 420
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 420 people's mortality was affected by this very small chance of getting
 hit by a car as they crossed the road.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further research is required to find factors that influence mortality which
 government policy is not already actively targetting.
 Influencing people's lifestyle choices has been shown to be a cost effective
 way of government to improve life expectancy.
 The majority of the population have inbuilt motivation to prolong their
 life and respond rapidly to research that purports to improve health.
 This makes lifestyle factors and their affect on mortality an interesteing
 area of further research.
